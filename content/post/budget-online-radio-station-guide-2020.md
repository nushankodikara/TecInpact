In this article, let me show you how I made an online radio station without wasting a single penny, or without sacrificing the quality

## Softwares And Services
If you are searching on this topic, chances are, you're probably a tech geek. But I'm creating this article noobs in mind, anyone can follow up this tutorial and if you are a geek, I'll present you with extra tips to experiment with. My goal is to use Shoutcast so in 3rd party services,
* Listen2myradio [Visit](http://www.listen2myradio.com/)

## Overview Guide
If you're a geek and want to do it your self, here's the deal, just create an account and complete it on Listen2myradio service and use winamp DSP or any other DSP software to stream your cast in to it and that's it. If you need my help, follow up this step-by-step guide.

## Listen2MyRadio
All right, they didn't sponsor me or anything like that, I chosed this option because of it's freely available features. let me show you, The provide you
* A Personal Page & A Personal Subdomain
* Shoutbox, Blog and Gallery
* Up to 5000 listeners without quality reduction
* Flash player & Windows Media Player
* Supported by Ads
* 3 server locations & Instant setup

For No Cost At All! If you reach your 5000 Listener count, you can expand your station for about 6.25$ / month in the time period I'm writing this. I'm pretty sure you aren't going to hit that limit sooner, so free radio for a much longer time!
Their theming options are very limited BTW. But modern and simple

### Setting Up Listen2MyRadio
I'm using a temp mail address to signup and stream a session.

#### Step 1

![Step 1](/uploads/20200711_01.png "Step 1")

Goto [www.listen2myradio.com](http://www.listen2myradio.com/) And Click on Sign Up button under Radio Streaming Section.

#### Step 2

![Step 2](/uploads/20200711_02.png "Step 2")

Fill up the signup form and click on create my account button

![Step 2](/uploads/20200711_03.png "Step 2")

If Everything Went well, You'll See a blue message at the top of the form.

![Step 2](/uploads/20200711_04.png "Step 2")

Now Go To your email viewer and confirm your account with the confirmation link provided.

![Step 2](/uploads/20200711_05.png "Step 2")

If you did it correctly, you'll be presented with this screen. Now select Return to login page.

#### Step 3

![Step 3](/uploads/20200711_06.png "Step 3")

Enter your email and password you just created and login

![Step 3](/uploads/20200711_07.png "Step 3")

From this page, select Audio account.

![Step 3](/uploads/20200711_08.png "Step 3")

This is an important step, so be careful with this one. Do Not USE CAPITAL LETTERS! Fill the form with your broadcast channel details and in the subdomain section, be careful with your selection, because it's your subdomain, it is the URL to listen to your radio station.

![Step 3](/uploads/20200711_09.png "Step 3")

On server Type, select Shoutcast, select UK Server and the broadcaster password is used to broadcast your stream in to the radio, so select a password wisely.

![Step 3](/uploads/20200711_10.png "Step 3")

If you didn't listened to me and added Capital letters, well fix it now!

![Step 3](/uploads/20200711_11.png "Step 3")

Here you can see, your broadcasting station is getting ready to deploy, it would take some time so grab a coffee or something to eat.

![Step 3](/uploads/20200711_12.png "Step 3")

If you did everything correctly, welcome to your dashboard DJ!

#### Step 4

![Step 4](/uploads/20200711_13.png "Step 4")

As I said before, you can have a blog and a gallery here, so if you're Interested go to this section.

![Step 4](/uploads/20200711_14.png "Step 4")

For this demonstration, I Don't need a blog or a gallery so I'm just disabling everything, if you want them, just enable it and you're good to go.

![Step 4](/uploads/20200711_15.png "Step 4")

Now, if you have eyes, you can see something red here, remember kids RED = BAD. so we need to fix it. Click on the first link which says Add Blog Post bla bla bla and wait for it to load.

![Step 4](/uploads/20200711_16.png "Step 4")

Now Here my friends, you can see the interface you have to deal with, if you are doing your Blog, but for no reason, you have to have a single post to start a stream, so I'm filling it up with a placeholder. Don't worry, this wont be published if you disabled the blog, if you need it, add something useful.

![Step 4](/uploads/20200711_17.png "Step 4")

If you did it correctly, now you can see your 1st post here. Enough work over here so lets continue with the secont link which says Add Gallery bla bla bla.

![Step 4](/uploads/20200711_18.png "Step 4")

Kids, this is the gallery manager, if you are using it, upload something special or useful, otherwise upload something, because again for no reason, you need to have a single gallery to stream.

![Step 4](/uploads/20200711_19.png "Step 4")

I Chosed this lovely picture of a headset and press save to gallery.

![Step 4](/uploads/20200711_20.png "Step 4")

If you did it correctly, you can see something like this. then we can get to our final step on fixing the server. click on the third red link which says please update radio text.

![Step 4](/uploads/20200711_21.png "Step 4")

now this is another important step. Channel name should be your channel name and it should have more than 10 characters, channel description should have more than 150 and About us should have more than 400 characters. upload your logo to stream icon, recheck your subdomain and press confirm! wait for a little bit and you'll be presented with this screen if everything went to the plan!

![Step 4](/uploads/20200711_22.png "Step 4")

Now select the big logo to go to your main dashboard, and it should be ready to stream.

![Step 4](/uploads/20200711_23.png "Step 4")

Notice something? yeah all the bad is gone! and we're ready to rock on.

### Setting Up Softwares
Here, we are using [Winamp](http://www.winamp.com/) And [Shoutcast](https://directory.shoutcast.com/Winamp) to setup a simple but professional setup. you can use something like Virtual DJ, SAM Broadcaster etc. but we are considering only free options in this post, if you need a complete guide on Virtual DJ and SAM Broadcaster, let me know in the comments. Download And install Winamp And Shoutcast Usually.

Follow up these steps, I don't think I want to explain this but I'll whenever it's required.

[Download](http://www.winamp.com/)

![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_24.png "Software Setup")
![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_25.png "Software Setup")
![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_26.png "Software Setup")
![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_27.png "Software Setup")
![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_28.png "Software Setup")
![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_29.png "Software Setup")
![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_30.png "Software Setup")
![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_31.png "Software Setup")

Now Here, If you don't see the Winamp like in the picture above just press this arrow key

![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_32.png "Software Setup")

Now Close the winamp completely and download and install Shoutcast

[Download](https://directory.shoutcast.com/Winamp)

![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_33.png "Software Setup")
![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_34.png "Software Setup")
![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_35.png "Software Setup")
![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_36.png "Software Setup")
![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_37.png "Software Setup")
![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_38.png "Software Setup")
![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_39.png "Software Setup")
![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_40.png "Software Setup")
![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_41.png "Software Setup")

Winamp would open up with a window like this, this is the window we're going to use to setup the radio stream. If you cant's see this window,

![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_41a.png "Software Setup")

Goto Options > Preferances

![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_41b.png "Software Setup")

Select on Plug-ins > DSP / Effect > SHOUTcast Source DSP > Configure active plugin

![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_42.png "Software Setup")

Now That out to the side, Copy the IP Address, Port and Stream Password

![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_43.png "Software Setup")

And Paste respectively in Server Address, Port and password. also change Connect Using to V1.x and DO NOT FILL DJ / User ID.

![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_44.png "Software Setup")

Enter your broadcast station name in the name section, your URL in the URL Section.

![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_45.png "Software Setup")

Select your bitrate you prefer to broadcast with

![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_46.png "Software Setup")

Select the 2nd option if you want to display song titles in the radio station.

![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_48.png "Software Setup")

Now, Select the Connect button, and Tick Auto connect if you want it to automatically connect to the server if something went wrong

![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_49.png "Software Setup")

You are ready to rock, you can see your data usage in the sent section and to be exact, your playing and the radio station has a slight delay to improve audio quality through buffering so it's natural.

### Streaming To Radio

All right mr.DJ, now you're ready to rock up. But first! create your play list in the winamp software and to start broadcasting, just play it! it's that simple, for programs, pre record your voiceover and add to the playlist. Unfortunately, for now, we don't have a method to speak live to the audience.

![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_50.png "Software Setup")

### Streaming link

You can give the subdomain to anyone to listen to your radio online, cloak in in dns to look legit maybe? I'll provide a future post on that manner.

![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_50a.png "Software Setup")

Now this is the subdomain you made. and your radio is streaming on this domain.

![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_51.png "Software Setup")

This is what the streaming page looks like alongside

![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_52.png "Software Setup")

If you're running an uninterrupted radio stream, don't forget to activate playlist repeat and maybe shuffle?

![Software Setup](/uploads/20200711_53.png "Software Setup")

Don't Forget to turn your stream off after the broadcast.

## Data Usage
This is something Very important to most of the users, I know. So I decided to calculate the maximum data consumption on common bitrates, for an hour. ( This is a theoretical maximum )

| Bitrate | Data Usage For 1 hour |
| :------ | :-------------------: |
| 64kbps  |        28.8 MB        |
| 96kbps  |        43.2 MB        |
| 112kbps |        50.4 MB        |
| 128kbps |        57.6 MB        |
| 160kbps |        72.0 MB        |
| 192kbps |        86.4 MB        |

Seems like pretty good for a starter, isn't it.

## Extending Plans
If you are going over 5000 simultaneous listeners, Listen2myradio has a packages suiting anyone. you can see more details [Here](http://www.listen2myradio.com/radio-order-shoutcast.php)

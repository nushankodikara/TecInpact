## Introduction

My favorite is Netlify, before you ask, and this is only an introduction guide to what we're going to explore in the near future. Let's get into the list

Heroku is a cloud platform as a service supporting several programming languages. One of the first cloud platforms, Heroku has been in development since June 2007, when it supported only the Ruby programming language, but now supports Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure, Python, PHP, and Go. Now with these stack, We'll use Node.js in the future. Now Why it's the #1? It's free tire makes it one of the best out there.

## #2 Netlify (My Personal Favorite) https://www.netlify.com

Netlify is a San Francisco-based cloud computing company that offers hosting and serverless backend services for web applications and static websites.

Its features include continuous deployment from Git across Netlify Edge, the company's global application delivery network infrastructure, serverless form handling, support for AWS Lambda functions, and full integration with Let's Encrypt. It provides both free and paid plans. And their workflow got my heart.

Netlify customers include Google, Facebook, Verizon, NBC, Samsung, Nike, Cisco, Atlassian, LiveChat, Unilever, TriNet, Loblaw, Wieden+Kennedy, HashiCorp, Vue.js, Citrix, Peloton, Kubernetes, Lodash, Smashing Magazine, and Sequoia Capital. Their free tire contains

## #3 Github Pages https://pages.github.com

![Github Pages](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2MsN8gpT6jY/maxresdefault.jpg)

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. Here you can also connect a custom domain and that's pretty much all you can do with it. But how ever, you'll get unlimited storage bandwidth and many more features with it.

## #4 Infinity free https://infinityfree.net

I Still don't believe the fact that this is real, but it is. This site offers completely free web-hosting without support and anyways who needs support? we are developers so we can manage it anyways, let's explore the options this service offers us.

* Unlimited Disk Space
* Unlimited Bandwidth

This is also a service like netlify and as they say Vercel is the best place to deploy any frontend app. Start by deploying with zero configuration to our global edge network. Scale dynamically to millions of pages without breaking a sweat. They also have a cool free tire and let's explore.

## #6 Free Hosting https://www.freehosting.com

![Free Hosting](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20200409224837/7-Best-Sites-For-Free-Web-Hosting.png)

FreeHosting.com offers you what other free web hosting services out there simply cannot. We give you the full range of tools and resources you need for creating all kinds of websites. Free hosting package is perfectly suitable for lightweight websites like Wordpress blog, Internet forum, or website built with our Site Builder. On average, free account can serve roughly 30000 daily visitors of PHP-based website, or virtually unlimited visitors of pure HTML website.

* 100% free hosting for lifetime
* Hosting for your own domain name
* Unmetered bandwidth
* Linux / Apache / PHP / MySQL
* One-time billed addons

## Difference

That would be like a Heaven for most of the developers I know, But they all have a secret to control traffic and so, I listed them in the descending order of the limitation. According to my calculations, #1 can handle more users daily than the #5 option but still #5 option can handle 30,000 Daily users and that's a huge amount and you won't need to pay a single dollar to get these options. So why do we pay for more hosting?

## Conclusion

Let's be real, These are unlikely but real, Try for yourself and see the difference. I love these services and currently I'm using Netlify as I said, And hope you'll use them too. Also This is an introduction for a post I'm planning to the future so stay tuned for that.

You can crack up-to CC 2020 Adobe softwares from this crack and Rest of us, Let's explore the options.

## Crack And How to use it

Let me clarify that AMTEmu by PainteR doesn’t require an Installation. It means it is completely portable and you can just extract it and use it in your pc.

The file you download from our website is in .zip format so it requires to be extracted using a software like winrar or 7-Zip.

> Note:
> Before extracting make sure to turn off your Windows Defender & other Antivirus until activation completes.

Now you find the folder where you see the Universal Adobe Patcher. Right-click on the logo and then click on run as administrator.

It will then launch a new window where you see various options. Don’t touch any of these options only select the product which you want to activate from the Path.

In my case, I am trying to activate Photoshop CC 2018 so I will choose Adobe CC 2018 from the menu. After choosing the product just click on the Patch button located right side below.

You will then see an Error message saying, **“Cannot Find The File**. Search The File?”. Just click on Ok and you will then see a new window appears.

All you need to do is choose **My Computer > Local Disk (C) > Program Files > Adobe**. In this folder look for the amtb.dll and select it then click on Open. (For x64 users who use x32 version, just follow this patch **My Computer > Local Disk (C) > Program Files (32bit) > Adobe**).

![TheFile](https://i2.wp.com/official-amtemu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2-1.jpg?resize=300%2C221&ssl=1)

That’s it you will see the Patched Successfully Message in the AMTEmu screen. Now just close the activator and turn on Antivirus (if you are using any).

![Done](https://i0.wp.com/official-amtemu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/3-1.jpg?resize=294%2C300&ssl=1)

After that restart your computer and when your PC reboots just open the Adobe Photoshop (or any product which you patched). Here you will see there is no option for the activation or countdown for the expiration of the trial.

Now you can use it for the rest of life without getting please activate notification from Adobe. This is the permanent solution to keep enjoying and using the best features of Photoshop or other products. You can activate any product by following the same steps above there could be a change of name but the steps are still the same.

## Introduction

Password managers are pieces of softwares which keep our passwords saved in somewhere to decrease the chances of forgetting them and resetting, some password managers also can auto fill data and sync between platforms for the user's convenience. Today, we're discussing about password managers, are they safe to use? what kinds of password managers we have and how to use them safely. So without further explanation, Let's get in to the post.

## Categories Of Password managers

To be honest, there are many categories passwords managers rely on but for the ease of study, we're categorizing existing password managers into 5 categories

| Type           | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.Free Online  | These password managers work online, cross platform and also they are free to use.                                                                                            |
| 2.Paid Online  | These Password managers also work like free online category but they have an subscription and you have to pay for them monthly or yearly.                                     |
| 3.Free Offline | These password managers are proprietary, and only work with a single system. Also they are offline                                                                            |
| 4.Paid Offline | These password managers work exactly as the free offline ones but you have to pay for the software in order to get it.                                                        |
| 5.Open-Source  | Here we have an interesting one, Open-Source means you can get the code of the password manager and modify, or compile for yourself for your use and they have no copyrights. |

We're exploring what each category contains and at the end, I'm reveling what I use and What I prefer to use. And also note these password managers are well tested and they keep our passwords pre-encrypted, which means no one can access our passwords without our Master password we used to lock the vault.

### 1.Free/Paid Online

Why both are in the same topic? These password managers offers a free and a paid version itself and These are the best password managers we have by now, There are more, but I don't trust them much.

This is my favorite type of password manager and What I use. They sync our passwords across all of our devices online and also without a single penny to waste on, Here I'm listing 4 password managers of this type.

#### #1 Bitwarden

Bitwarden is a free and open-source password management service that stores sensitive information such as website credentials in an encrypted vault. The Bitwarden platform offers a variety of client applications including a web interface, desktop applications, browser extensions, mobile apps, and a CLI. Which means, It's very powerful and you can visit their website https://bitwarden.com for more information and download links.

#### #2 LastPass

LastPass is a freemium password manager that stores encrypted passwords online. The standard version of LastPass comes with a web interface, but also includes plugins for various web browsers and apps for many smartphones. It also includes support for bookmarklets. LogMeIn, Inc. acquired LastPass in October 2015. It doesn't have a CLI but it's powerful as much as Bitwarden. you can visit https://www.lastpass.com for more information and download links.

#### #4 DashLane

It's a somewhat popular solution but why in the fourth place? Because it only supports a single device on free version, which renders it useless for most of the users. But in the paid version, It's another story. DashLane is a cross-platform subscription-based password manager and digital wallet application available on macOS, Windows, iOS and Android. DashLane uses a Freemium pricing model which includes both a free tier and a premium subscription. Goto https://www.dashlane.com for more information and download links.

Now let's consider free and paid offline password managers, These doesn't have support for cross platform synchronizations but it would work for users who only has a single device.

### 2.Free/Paid offline

These password managers are somewhat preferable but I don't use any of these because I need a sync feature. But It's way secure than using a text file or a note book to save passwords.

#### #1 Enpass

This is also a modern looking but a not-much-popular password manager that also works perfectly. You store all your passwords locally on your device, and can optionally sync them across devices using your own trusted cloud accounts. None of your secured-data reaches our servers. Total peace of mind. Which means something like GDrive OneDrive Dropbox iCloud or Box can sync your passwords cross-platform optionally. goto https://www.enpass.io for more information and download links

#### #2 1password

This is also a popular password manager, and comparing to others, It Has a modern UI And UX design. They Say "The easiest and safest way to share logins, passwords, credit cards and more, with the people that matter most. Go ahead, forget your passwords" About their product and I agree with it however. This one also has a paid version so It's more versatile than others. as always https://1password.com can show you more information and download links.

#### #3 KeePass

This is a big one. KeePass is a free open source password manager, which helps you to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can store all your passwords in one database, which is locked with a master key. So you only have to remember one single master key to unlock the whole database. Database files are encrypted using the best and most secure encryption algorithms currently known (AES-256, ChaCha20 and Twofish).

Well, now that out to the way, Let's explore Open-Source Options.

### 3.Open-Source

Now here, I'm not going to introduce some new password managers, I'm just listing OpenSource options from above password managers because they are the best according to my view, because of their versatility and encryptability. If I found something new, I'll make a explanation on it.

1. [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com)
2. [Passbolt](https://www.passbolt.com) (It's totally online)
3. [KeePass](https://keepass.info)
4. [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org)

All of these are available on github and you can also download for free. And in the future, I'll make a complete guide on how to develop open-source Softwares for everyone.

## Conclusion

Here, We have a tool to make our lives easier. Now I use LastPass but I prefer Bitwarden because of it's versatility. However why I use LastPass? I started with LastPass and stucked in it by this time and within no time, I'm also switching to Bitwarden. Should you buy a password manager? If you're an enterprise, You should. because premium versions have more options for enterprises for more than personal users.

Most of the users are afraid that they'll leak their passwords to hackers if they use password managers. But no! These softwares I listed use 256bit Encryption and don't worry it won't happen at all. By the way, in case you don't hold nuclear secrets in your accounts, so what's so special? Live smartly not hardly!

# Introduction
I Was surprised and wasn't sure is this a spam or not. Top Level domains for free? that's Odd to be exact, But yeah, Freenom offers top level domains for no cost at all! and that's weird. In this article, I'll show you how you can get a Freenom top level domain for free and in the correct way. Follow this guide very carefully because anyone can f*ck it up in no time.

## How do they do that?
Well, Freenom offers free domains of .tk .ml .ga .cf .gq extensions for no cost at all, But how do they do that? I didn't found any good explanation on how they do that or anything I can believe, so I came up with my own theory on this conspiracy. No they aren't aliens or something like that. These are domain zones of small exotic countries or even semi-independent parts of other countries â€“ sometimes just a couple of islands in the ocean. so as silicon valley in china, they don't give a F*ck on world costs or nothing. And they have pretty flat rates on mostly every single domain name. Also they have a 99.9% online rate so I don't see anything bad about them.

## Where Are these domains From?

| TLD  | Corresponding country or territory                                                                                                                               |
| :--- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| .tk  | Tokelau, three coral islands in the Pacific Ocean with a capital that rotates between the islands each year. De-jure part of New Zealand.                        |
| .ml  | Mali, a landlocked country in North-West Africa with a 10% rate of Internet use among its entire 20 million population.                                          |
| .ga  | Gabon, a small nation on the western coast of Africa which has recently undergone a military coup against its president.                                         |
| .cf  | Central African Republic, a country where 4% of inhabitants have regular access to the Internet. Obviously located smack in the center of the African continent. |
| .gq  | Equatorial Guinea, a tiny African country with a totalitarian government that accumulates all the spoils from its rich oil reserves.                             |

## Are these safe?
Let me introduce my self in this part. These aren't safe at all because most of the scammers use them and even google rejects them. **BUT I HAVE A SOLUTION**.

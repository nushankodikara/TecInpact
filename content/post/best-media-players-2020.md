# Introduction
In this post, I would like to present to you with the best media players according to technologies they use. This is a weird post to make in this time period but I'm creating this as a follow-up for a new post I'm planning to post in the future about Online Radio Broadcasting Technologies.
## What I'm Considering Here
Well, While I'm Preparing the list, I was considering about several features to back it up with. We Humans are highly on to habits and we don't consider newer technologies or novelties that much, which in most cases make us miss important and easier, maybe more stable options, without even a clue. So I made the list by looking foward on
* Codecs
* Stability
* Intergration
* User-Interface
* User-Experiance
* Installation
* Playlist Creation
* User Hot keys
* Added Features
* Resource Usage

## Why Should I Even Care?
First of all, about the mess chris made with his Anti-VLC Situation, I'm not forcing anyone to change their life style here, but you should look what's out there in the field and make yourself comfortable with the situation.

## Installation
I Will provide choco commands and links for every player. If you don't know what choco is, check out [choco](/post/the-package-manager-for-windows-chocolatey/)

# Windows
## #1 Media Player Classic
Wait, What? But, Yes. Media player classic is the best media player for windows considering the backend technologies and the resource usage. also MPC has the most wide range of codec support amoung all of the other competitors. It's extremely light weight and lightning fast. But it has a outdated user-interface BTW.

## #2 KMPlayer
This is a popular player but it consumes alot of resources so it wont be ideal for small systems and low ram machines. so if you're considering using KMPlayer, it has a wide range of codec support and VR Viewing if you're into those kinds of things. I personally use KMP on my mainstream PC, but not for my laptops.

## #3 VLC
Here it is, the most famous and widely used media player in the whole universe. but do everyone right about their decision? well, not at all. why? VLC has a lot more going in it's back end. it has it's own codecs, it uses more ram and so on. But, if you're an Advanced User, I won't bother you at all. For Others, Just Don't use it. It's flimsy and not good for me.

# Linux
## #1 Celluloid
Celluloid (formerly GNOME MPV) is a simple GTK+ frontend for mpv. It aims to be easy to use while maintaining high level of configurability. Celluloid is capable of using mpv's configuration files as-is. Keybindings can be set up using mpv's input configuration file. The playlist entries can be added, removed, or rearranged easily with drag and drop operations. Celluloid implements the MPRIS D-Bus Interface. This allows for better integration with desktop environments that have compatible MPRIS clients. Also Celluloid is fully functional on Wayland.

## #2 VLC
For the VLC Fans, here it is again in the show! But considering linux, VLC Isn't as good as on windows. why? probably their back end. VLC is designed for windows and that's where it's peak at. for linux, it's another story. it LAGS! that's my problem with it.

# Android

# Conclusion
After all, at the end of the day, we're using our favourite players to play our favourite songs no matter how boring or no matter how technologically down they are, but It's worth giving a shot out to these newcomers and re-imagine our lives with them.

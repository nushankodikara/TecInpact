# Introduction

Code editors are usually overpowered text editors. Mainly they are used for editing codes, but in the modern world, code editors are playing a role of complete development environments for some frameworks, with the help of extensions.

In this article, I would like to present you my most favourite code editors and also some download links, and typical extensions I use.

## #1 Visual Studio Code

Visual studio code is a multi talented and an open source project by Microsoft. And also it's available for Windows Linux and Mac OS users. I use visual studio code mainly for web developments, cross platform app development, design and prototyping, server side scripting and as a typical code editor for other projects.

With this editor, I also use live server extension, SCSS compiler, HTML beautifier, HTML minifier extensions regularly, also you can find them in the visual studio code extension marketplace.

> Key Features
>
> * cross-platform
> * open source via MIT license (Github link)
> * built-in Git (including merge conflicts, diff checking, and modified file tracking from within the editor)
> * in-editor debugging
> * large library of extensions and plugins
> * compatible with nearly every programming language
> * very lightweight in comparison to other, similarly robust editors
> * quick and responsive
> * specific Linux distros for Ubuntu, Fedora, SUSE, Red Hat, and Debian
> * IntelliSense highlighting and autocomplete works like a dream

## #2 Atom

Atom is another great text editor, in this case a perfect code editor made by GitHub but now owned by Microsoft. Microsoft development team is maintaining the atom code editor for a while now and it established a perfect user base and established as a premiere text and code editor out there. The best part is that Atom is totally free, open source, and highly customizable. Built around a minimal core, Atom comes with multiple language-specific packages built in, and the library of community-written ones has exploded over the years since the editor was first released. Atom is as robust as you need it to be – if the editor doesn’t do something you need, you can create that feature yourself. The Teletype features has been embraced by users, too. It allows multiple developers to work on the same code from remote locations.

## #3 Sublime Text

Sublime text is something different from others, it was designed coding on mind. It has some cons when comparing to something like visual studio code, but for the working part it's doing perfectly, but this doesn't support extensions by this time. Sublime text can be used as a portable text editor and it's mostly usable for web developments & simple code writing.

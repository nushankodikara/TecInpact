# Introduction

Code editors are usually overpowered text editors. Mainly they are used for editing codes, but in the modern world, code editors are playing a role of complete development environments for some frameworks, with the help of extensions.

In this article, I would like to present you my most favourite code editors and also some download links, and typical extensions I use.

Visual studio code is a multi talented and an open source project by Microsoft. And also it's available for Windows Linux and Mac OS users. I use visual studio code mainly for web developments, cross platform app development, design and prototyping, server side scripting and as a typical code editor for other projects.

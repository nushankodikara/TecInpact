# Introduction
No matter what profession you are in, in a certain period of time, you are going to face a situation which you need some materials royalty free for your projects, maybe Images, videos, sound clips etc.. So in this article, let me show you my pics for royalty free Resource collections.

# But, first, let’s go over some basic royalty-free terms.

* **Royalty-Free**: This allows you to use intellectual property without having to pay royalties or license fees.
* **Creative Commons**: You can use these images for free since the artist has waived their rights to their work. However, always review the terms before publishing these images.
* **Public Domain**: If any image was created in the United States prior to 1923 then they’re part of the public domain. This means that you’re allowed to copy, modify, or distribute these images without permission.
* **Attribution**: You can use these images as long as you give credit to the author.
* **Commercial Use**: You’re permitted to use royalty-free images for any type of business venture.
* **Membership**: You must sign-up to the site in order to use the royalty-free images. Some sites will charge you for membership.

Now that out to the side, let's begin shall we?

# Images

### [Stocksnap](https://stocksnap.io/)
Stock snap is the biggest site of three of these, but I always end-up with Unsplash for my daily needs ( As a habit ). but you shouldn't do that, so check this also.

Burst by shopify, as it says, It's from shopify. This site is also licensed under Creative Commons Zero and you're already know the drill.

I'll do a 101 Royalty free image sites in the future and stay tuned for that.

# Videos
As same as images, but now for videos.
### [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/videos/)
My Go-to site for Royalty free videos is, again pixabay. It has a lot more than photos so I'm secretly into pixabay.

### [Videovo](https://www.videvo.net/)
This is something special, Videvo offers free stock video footage as well as motion graphics created by their community of users. The clips you download from Videvo will be licensed in one of two ways: either through the Videvo Standard License or the Creative Commons 3.0 license. Videos under the Videvo Standard License can be downloaded for free to use in any project, the only restriction being that you don’t make the clips available for download anywhere else.

# Audio
Here, we have free effects and background musics. Considering audio, It's hard to look for what we exactly needs, unless the search engine and publishers knows what we feel more than what we meant.

### [Youtube Audio Library](https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music)
I Bet you didn't saw this coming, Yeah it's from Youtube and for background musics. You're welcomed.

### [Facebook Sound Collection](https://www.facebook.com/creatorstudio/?reference=redirect_from_sound_collection&tab=sound_collection&context_id=0&collection_id=all_pages&sound_collection_tab=sound_tracks)
Facebook sound collection is a part of Creator Studio. It strongly resembles the looks of YouTube audio library. However, they offer less filters and some of the songs I found were quite heavy (30-70 Mb). But give it a try anyway: your next best free music might be hiding here.

### [Freesound](https://freesound.org/)

### [Zapsplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/)

### [Wave](https://wave.video/)
This is my go-to for audio clips, it has amazing audio clips and the search engine knows what we want. But there's a bummer and it's featuring so much premium content, so not suitable for most of us.

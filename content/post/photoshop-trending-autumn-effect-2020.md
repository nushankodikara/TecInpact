# Introduction
Autumn effect is something now getting in trend on social medias, It's a simple filter but most of the softwares get it wrong and making a messed up look but untrained eye isn't going to notice that until doing some post processing. Here Let's re-create that effect on photoshop so it's more versatile for more adjustments. Here's a before and after photo of me (Not the prettiest one but it worked) with the effect applied

## Let's Get Started.
First thing's first, import the photo into the photoshop and duplicate the layer so we can work with more confidence.

Now, you have to create an adjustment layer by clicking on the adjustment layer icon

And creating a channel mixer from that menu and now there should be the channel mixer window with the adjustment layer applied.

Here you have to change some values to create the effect base first. Change values to
* Red   - +95
* Green - +100
* Blue  - -100

And you'll get something like this.

Here, It's almost looking perfect, but we can do few more adjustments (Because It's photoshop) to pop up the colors and increase the quality of this photo. First, I'm adding a curves adjustment layer by clicking on the adjustment layer icon and selecting curves adjustment layer. Now it's time to play with the curves and get the desired look we're hunting for.

This could be different from photo to photo so you have to do some experiment in order to get something you like, and something the photo desire. But first, I'm adding a Brightness/Contrast Adjustment layer to adjust a brightness a bit and here are my values.

My photo has washed out blue colors if you can see, so I'm going to add some blues from the Channel mixer I made before. double click on the channel mixer to get the control panel back. And I'm tweaking the values of the blue channel and I found It's best to add -112 to the blue channel makes the photo more pleasing to my taste, maybe could get different on yours so experiment with it.

And Wolah! Here's the finished photo.

# Conclusion
Well, here you go it's a nice and simple effect most of the users doesn't know about. we can create more stunning looking photos from photoshop than using pre-made color filters so I'm preferring this method over others.

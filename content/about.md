# TECINPACT Technology Guide
### Introduction

TECINPACT is a Digital Guide Book to navigate through the 21st century cyber space in a safe and cheap manner. As we can get most of the products and services we're paying for pennies, my vision here is to support the non-geeks and starters to start their Cyber career with a boost.

As I'm Planning to publish most of the content out-of-charge, it would be nice if you can share and support the site on further developments, also you can contact me anytime over my social media links with the short bio.

I Would cover on

* Web Development And Administration
* Modern Web Technologies
* Mobile App Development And Technologies
* Desktop Software Development And Technologies
* Operating Systems And Utility Softwares
* Hobby Project Ideas

As A Daily Base

### Format

My Posts would be in a step-by-step order, in order to make it easier to follow up. However reviews and those kinds of posts would review the software or the technology and provide you with resource links or download links at the bottom of the page.
